  <h2>Imagine This...</h2>
    <p>Imagine loading into a match as a survivor on Coldwind Farm. You casually hop onto a generator nearby and make some solid progress on it before the Wraith finds you and starts a chase. It seems like you are reading every one of the Wraith's mindgames. He doubles back and you keep running for distance. You loop the killer around a cowtree and then pallet stun him right as he swings. The same thing happens at the killer's shack. The killer continues to commit to you until he finally uses bloodlust and gets you down. You look at the bottom-left corner of your screen and see that only one generator has popped in the two minutes the killer was chasing you. As you are picked up, you see your teammates wasting the precious time you gave them while being chased. One teammate was chasing you trying to get a flashlight save, one cleansing a dull totem, and another hopping into a locker just in case the killer has Bar-B-Q and Chili. As the Wraith face-camps you until you die, your teammates continue to waste their time. The end result of the game is that nobody escapes and everyone says "gg" in the chat after. The best part of this story is that you do not have to imagine it happening because it has happened to all of us before. This is happened so often that their are countless memes made about how bad teammates can be in Dead by Daylight.</p>

    <h2>Now Imagine This...</h2>
      <p>You hop on Dead by Daylight and have a list of friends who are online already looking for teammates. You invite a few of them to your lobby and end up getting a full survive with friends lobby. You load in together to a match on Coldwind Farms. You casually hop onto a generator nearby and make some solid progress on it before the Wraith finds you and starts a chase. It seems like you are reading every one of the Wraith's mindgames. He doubles back and you keep running for distance. You loop the killer around a cowtree and then pallet stun him right as he swings. The same thing happens at the killer's shack. The killer continues to commit to you until he finally uses bloodlust and gets you down. You look at the bottom-left corner of your screen and see that only one generator is left before the exit gates open. As you are picked up, you see two of your teammates on a generator and the third one running over getting ready to save you. The final generator pops but there is a problem because the Wraith is face-camping you. Your team works together to get you off the hook and takes protection hits so you all get out. The end result of the game is that everybody escapes and says "gg" in the chat after. This might have happened to us a few times in our Dead by Daylight career but not consistently. This website is here to make this a consistent thing so that the overall status of the game is more enjoyable and at a higher skill level. So what are you waiting for?
